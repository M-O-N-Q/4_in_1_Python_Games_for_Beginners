# 4_in_1_Python_Games_for_Beginners

I have just started learning python programming, and I want to practice by making simple programs based on the ideas I got from the web, so I made a 4 game in 1 using python 
that let me understand how to use simple variables, loops, data type conversions, if esle statements, concatinationt and random numbers.

1. Guess the number from 1-9
2. Mad Libs
3. Roll a Die
4. Math game

-Guess that number from one to nine is ovbious based on its name

-Mad libs is a game I found on the web where the user would input a word and add that word to a pre-made phrases or sentences

-Roll a Die is as simple as rolling a 6 sided dice

-Math Game is a game I made myself, since making a calculator is too outdated.
  I made two variables to have random numbers from 0 to 100
  These two numbers would be either added, subtracted, multiplid or divided to each other ( ranndom number a {+ - * /} random number b = answer)

I used while to loop the whole game so one could play again
I used if else for the conditional statements
I used int(), string() and float() for the conversions
I used isdigit() and isalpha() to prevent incorrect inputs
